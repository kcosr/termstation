# Contributing to TermStation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TermStation!

## Current Status

TermStation is in its very early days of being open source. The developer is new to GitHub, open source project management, JavaScript/TypeScript, and many of the conventions that developers take for granted.

**For the first few days (as of 12/3/2025), please do not open issues or PRs as the developer will be working through documenting known issues.** Use [Discussions](https://github.com/kcosr/termstation/discussions) for questions, or reach out to @kcosr on X.

## How You Can Help

The developer would appreciate guidance and help in the following areas:

### Project Management
- GitHub repository best practices and conventions
- Issue and PR templates
- Labeling and milestone strategies
- Release management and versioning (semver, changelogs)
- Branch naming conventions and protection rules

### Repository Structure
- Monorepo vs separate repositories (currently a monorepo with shared dependencies between backend, frontend, desktop, and mobile)
- Package management and workspaces (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Dependency management between components

### Installation and Upgrades
- Installer best practices (currently a bash script)
- Upgrade/migration strategies for existing installations
- Systemd service file management
- Configuration file versioning and migrations

### Code Quality
- ESLint/Prettier configuration for consistency
- Testing strategies and coverage expectations
- Code review processes
- CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions)

### Documentation
- README and documentation standards
- API documentation approaches
- Code commenting conventions
- Architecture documentation

### Open Source Practices
- License considerations
- Code of conduct
- Community building
- Handling contributions from others

## Technology Stack

### Current
- **Backend**: Node.js (JavaScript/ES Modules)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + HTML + CSS (no framework)
- **Desktop**: Electron
- **Mobile**: Capacitor
- **Container Runtime**: Podman/Docker
- **Testing**: Vitest (backend)

### Planned
- **Backend rewrite**: TypeScript (from JavaScript)
- The developer's background is in C++ and is learning JS/TS conventions as he goes

## Development Setup

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

For backend development:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test          # Run tests (Vitest)
npm start         # Start the backend
```

For frontend development:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start         # Start the frontend server
```

## Code Style

The codebase currently lacks consistent style enforcement. Help setting up and configuring linting/formatting tools would be appreciated.

Current observations:
- Backend uses ES Modules (`import`/`export`)
- 2-space indentation is generally used
- Single quotes for strings (mostly)

## Testing

Backend tests are located in `backend/tests/` and use Vitest.

```bash
cd backend
npm test                              # Run all tests
npx vitest run tests/<file>.test.mjs  # Run specific test file
```

New tests should:
- Use helpers from `backend/tests/helpers/test-utils.mjs` for isolated config directories
- Have descriptive `describe`/`it` names
- Be isolated (no reliance on global state across files)

## A Note on AI-Generated Code

100% of the TermStation codebase was generated by Claude and Codex. The developer directs the work but does not write code directly. This is an intentional approach and contributions following this pattern are welcome, though not required.
